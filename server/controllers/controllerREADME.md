The CitiesController is simply:

1)city, the findOne wrapper for mongoose for
a given city name, which has to be EXACT.

2)cities, the find wrapper for all the cities
 
Frontend must parse for the name which I imagine should be from a dropdown typeable box
using data from cities

Can't offload error checking without lots of https requests

WeatherController is a wrapper for Darksky API calls;
